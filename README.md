# LawnBot (In Progress)

![In Progress Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-orange)  
This repository documents the development of a **Wi-Fi-controlled lawn mowing robot** built around a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** and a **DrRobot motor driver**. The robot is designed to mow lawns autonomously or via manual control over a web interface. 

The project combines **custom hardware (PCB design)**, **embedded software in C/C++**, and a lightweight **web UI** for control and testing.

## Preview 
Realtime WebSocket communication Demo

## üîß Current Features 
- Wi-Fi connectivity established through Pico 2 W  
- WebSocket communication pipeline between Pico and browser
- Basic motor control via DrRobot driver
- Obtacle detection with ToF sensors
- Test web interface for manual control (arrows, toggles, etc.)

## Hardware
- **Raspberry pi pico W2**
- **Custom PCB** (prototype + ongoing design)
- **Tof Sensor**
- **12V Motors with encoders** (planned)
- **DRI0044 DFrobot Dual motor driver**
- **12V Brushless DC motor with ESC**
- **Li-ion battery pack**

## How It Works
The Pico handles incoming HTTP requests, proccess WebSocket events, communicates to the client and controls motors with Core 0, while also cmonitoring sensor readings at set intervals with Core 1.

*Flowchart of code flow*

## PCB Development
first PCB was successfully designed, manufactured, and tested.
- ‚úÖ Verified core functionality: Pico W2, motor driver, and power delivery
- ‚ùå Issues identified:
  * Missing decoupling capacitors led to noise and unwanted voltage spikes
  * No support for motor encoders
  * No ToF sensor integration
  * Lack of test points and indicator LEDs for debugging
- A redesigned PCB id currently in progress with fixes and explained functionality.

## Setup Instructions 
1) Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ChidumamAmadi-Obi/LawnBot.git
cd src/main
```
2) Open main.ino in ArduinoIDE with Raspberry Pi Pico board support (Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040/RP2350 by Earle F. Philhower, III)
3) Make a new header file and name it *SSID.h*
4) In *SSID.h* copy these variables and fill out your wifi credentials:
```
const char* SSID = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
```
5) Connect sensors and motors as per wiring diagram
```
  //PIN CONFIG
  constexpr uint8_t PWM2 = 0;
  constexpr uint8_t PWM1 = 1;
  constexpr uint8_t DIR2 = 2;
  constexpr uint8_t DIR1 = 3;
  constexpr uint8_t BDLC_PWM_PIN = 16;
  constexpr uint8_t WIFI_LED_PIN = 17;
```

7) Save this header file, and flash the code onto the Pico
8) Connect to the Pico's WiFi network and open the web interface for control
