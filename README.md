# LawnBot (In Progress)
This repository documents the development of a **Wi-Fi-controlled lawn mowing robot** built around a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** and a **DrRobot motor driver**.  
The robot is designed to mow lawns autonomously or via manual control over a web interface. 

The project combines **custom hardware (PCB design)**, **embedded software in C/C++**, and a lightweight **web UI** for control and testing.

## üîß Current Features 
- Wi-Fi connectivity established through Pico 2 W  
- WebSocket communication pipeline between Pico and browser
- Basic motor control via DrRobot driver  
- Test web interface for manual control (arrows, toggles, etc.)
